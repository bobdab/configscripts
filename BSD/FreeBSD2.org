* Basic Tasks in BSD

** Firmware
# Get the athn firmware from firmware.openbsd.org and put in /etc/firmware

** Disks
# List disks
sysctl hw.disknames

# Show more detail on disk sd0
fdisk sd0

# Get the correct letter for the disk name
disklabel sd0

# Mount an ext2 disk
mkdir /mnt/F256
mount_ext2fs /dev/sdaj /mnt/F256
# or 
mount -t ext2fs /dev/sdaj /mnt/F256

# Note that in PC-BSD, there is a disk tray on the
# bottom right that can mount EXT 2 and others,
# but it might mount them as 'ext4' with limit functionality.

** Connect to Wifi
# The interface is different on OpenBSD and FreeBSD
# I think this one is OpenBSD... FreeBSD 10.1 does not 
# have the wpakey argument:
ifconfig athn0 nwid "NameOfWifiNetwork" wpakey THEPASSWORD
ifconfig athn0 up
dhclient athn0

# list wifi connections on interface called wlan0:
ifconfig -v wlan0 list scan
